# Edd Feedback

Edd Feedback is add-on plugin for Easy Digital Downloads. It gives you power to sent
automatic emails and ask feedback of your products.

## Commercial Plugin

EDD Members is a commercial Plugin available in my site [Foxland](https://foxland.fi/downloads/edd-feedback/). The plugin is hosted here
on a public Github repository in order to better faciliate community contributions from developers and users alike.
If you have a suggestion, a bug report, or a patch for an issue, you can submit it here.

If you are using the plugin on a live site it would be cool that you purchase a valid license from [Plugin page](https://foxland.fi/downloads/edd-feedback/).
After that you get support and automatic updates.
